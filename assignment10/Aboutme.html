            <p>What I stand to accomplish is stability in my life and I believe my art will show that balance I look to achieve. I have been drawing since I was a little kid and my understanding of human anatomy as well as some animals continues to rise with the little resources I had available to me. Now that I have resources and guidance at a college level I beleive the next step I take will be much greater and it will show in the next project I have coming up for myself with new fuel added to the fire that drives me. I have created websites, experiemented with software like Photoshop, Blender, Unity, and I have worked with an experienced comic book artist Steve Bryant who has challenged me to bring out the best. There will be more to come as I progress in my skill and I plan to show my versatility as well once I have gottne better at other skills in the field such as game development, 3d animation, and 2d animation.</p>
